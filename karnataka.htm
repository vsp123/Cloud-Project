<b>Karnataka Cuisine: </b>
<br>One of the oldest known Indian cuisines is from the picturesque state of Karnataka, Kannada cuisine is a felicity for a foodie. Like all other peninsular states of India, Karnataka is ahead in the use of rice in cooking, too. Bisibele Bhath, Avalakki, Chitranna, and Vaangi Bhath are a few rice preparations that the ‘Bhath’ lovers crave. A Kannada thali (Oota) consists of a variety of delicious items like Bajra/Jowar/Wheat Roti, Pickle, Palya, Gojju, Raita, Payasa, Thovve, Chitranna, Rice, and Ghee. Mysore Pak, Phenori, Unde, Belle Saru are some of the delectable sweets that Kannadigas love passionately.
The famous traditional south Indian breakfasts like idli, vada and masala dosa was invented in Karnataka in the temple streets of Udupi, which has now become the traditional South Indian food. 
<br>Described as the mildest in terms of spice content of the five southern states' cuisines, there is a generous use of jaggery, palm sugar and little use of chili powder however Northern Karnataka cuisine, which can be extremely hot, is an exception. 
<br>Since the percentage of vegetarians in Karnataka is higher than other southern states, vegetarian food enjoys widespread popularity.
