PROCEDURE</i></b></h2>
<ul style="color:black;font-size:20px">
   <li>Add all the cut vegetables except mangoes to a large cooking pot (we use the traditional kal chatti or stone pot to make avial at home).</li>
<li>Top off with half the turmeric powder, cumin, curry leaves, and chilli powder.
Add about ½ to ¾ cup water and mix well.</li>
<li>Cook covered on a low flame for about 10-12 mins or until the vegetables are cooked yet hold their shape.
Take care not to cook them to a mush, I would suggest checking every 5 mins to confirm this.
Meanwhile, grind together - coconut + green chillies + remaining turmeric + some more curry leaves to a coarse paste without adding water.</li>
<li>Check that your vegetables are almost cooked.
They would have let out a fair amount of water while cooking and this is good.</li>
<li>Add the ground coconut mixture on top along with requirement amount of salt and the mango strips.
Without mixing, cook covered for another 3-4 mins.
Almost done! Mix the coconut mixture in gently and remove from heat.</li>
<li>The avial will be a bit watery still but it will dry up as the vegetables absorb it as they sit.
Drizzle the coconut oil on top and mix gently.</li>
<li>Set aside covered loosely for an hour before serving.</li>
</ul>
